# HTML5/CSS3 Media Center Experiment

## Background

This is an experimental project. Build a media center type of interface with web technologies (CSS3/HTML5/JS). Not intended for actually use, it's just a sandbox to experiment with fancy CSS :)

## TODO

* Use templates instead of building HTML with string concat or DOM API
* Implement proper responsive layout to work across devices
* Test on other browsers than webkit or gecko based
* Convert screen transition from margin transition to translate animation (better for perf?)
* Use SCSS to avoid repeating all the prefixed properties
* Create remaining screens (tiles for videos, games, ... chat ui, list of messages, store front...)
* Add support for keyboard navigation
* Figure out a way to combine 3 icon fonts into one (ask ZURB?), maybe use data-uri?
* Use push state API to handle history
* Find a better background
* Optimize load time, maybe add load screen?
